# Delivery Schedule Integration with POS System

## Overview

The cart page now automatically captures delivery details from the POS system and creates Delivery Schedule records in the fence_supply app when orders are placed.

## What's New

### 1. Enhanced Delivery Schedule DocType

**Added Field:**
- `delivery_time` (Time) - Captures the specific delivery time from POS

### 2. Cart Page Integration

**Features:**
- Automatically reads POS configuration from sessionStorage
- Displays delivery details on the cart page
- Passes delivery information to backend during checkout
- Creates Delivery Schedule record when placing orders

### 3. Document Creation Workflow

```
POS System → Cart Page → Sales Order + Delivery Schedule
```

When a customer proceeds from POS to cart with delivery selected:

1. **POS Configuration Transfer**: Delivery details stored in sessionStorage
2. **Cart Display**: Shows delivery method, date, time, and fence specifications  
3. **Order Placement**: Creates both Sales Order and Delivery Schedule
4. **Cleanup**: Removes POS configuration after successful order

## Document Structure

### Delivery Schedule Record Contains:

- **Customer Information**: Customer name and details
- **Delivery Details**: Date, time, and address
- **Items**: Complete list of ordered items with quantities
- **POS Context**: Fence specifications (material, style, height, color)
- **Status**: Initially set to "Scheduled"
- **Notes**: Links back to original Sales Order with specifications
